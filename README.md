# Int-Inv-Exp-Percolation
In this project I aim to verify the effect of percolation in the elasticity and hence resistance to breaking of different MDF materials given that this will have holes carved by a laser CO2 cutting machine at different hole size and different MDF width.The first set of experiments consisted of cutting the next image patterns in 3mm width MDF of  a dimension of 36 cm x 5cm, of these 36 cm 5 where used to hold the material in a stable position while another centimeter was used at the opposite side to add progressively weights of 15,64 g every 20 seconds.
